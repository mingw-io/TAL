TAL Coding Exercise
-------------------

Project: Identity Service

This project acts as a Authorization Service provinding JWT tokens to clients (a.k.a. users).

This server will receive a HTTP incoming request (POST verb or method) with the user's credentials
in the body of the request.

After validating the input arguments, this server will look up the user in some repository (e.g. database).
If the user is found, and its credentials are ok, then this server will provide a valid token to the client.

This Authorization server is a standalone server, which allows for multiple and different consuming clients.
This server could also be easily adapted or enhanced with offering several authentication methods (e.g. OpenAPI, etc.)
